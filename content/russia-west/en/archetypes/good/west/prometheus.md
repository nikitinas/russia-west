# Prometheus

## Origin

Greek myth. The rebel hero who defied the gods and brought fire to humans (knowledge, progress, civilization).

## What it represents

Daring, creativity, readiness to suffer for the future. Symbol of knowledge and progress as liberation. Its distortion is the Golem: fire out of control. For Russia, the Western “Prometheus” is often read as “Satan” (tempter, substitution of freedom for rupture of bonds).
