# Dragon (Archaic regression)

## Origin

European medieval epic. Unlike Zmey Gorynych—often a one- or three-headed lizard in a cave, guarding treasure.

## Appearance

An ancient winged lizard on a hoard of gold in his castle. Old, cunning, incredibly greedy. Does not build the new—guards the old.

## Which ideal is distorted

Distortion of the Knight. The Knight seeks the Holy Grail (ideal, development); the Dragon guards treasure, not letting it be used. Power based on accumulation and threat of force, not service to an ideal. Regression, stagnation.

## Key traits

- Greed and archaism: hoards gold, does not use it; terrorizes the neighborhood, demanding tribute (often maidens).
- Stagnant ancient evil clinging to the past, resisting progress.
- Aim—to preserve the status quo in which he is the sole ruler.

## Logic of behavior

“Don’t kick a man when he’s down, but I won’t give gold either.” Terrorizes, demanding tribute, does not use what he has hoarded. Any change is a threat.

## Core sin

Greed, regression, parasitism on fear, denial of the future.

## Projection onto Russia

Russia as “gas station with nukes”: sits on resources (“pining over gold”), cannot use them effectively for development. Archaic values (tradition, church, empire). Demands tribute (“gas for rubles”), terrorizes neighbors. Russia’s economic sovereignty and import substitution the West reads as confirmation of the Dragon.
