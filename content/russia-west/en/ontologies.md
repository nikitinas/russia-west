# Different Ontologies: Human and World

The root of the confrontation lies in the answer to: “Who is the human and how is he or she connected to the world?”

## Russian ontology: Human → Nature → Society

The human is born and feels **part of the natural whole**. Nature is not a lifeless resource but a living home, “Mother moist earth.” Society (the community) grows from this bond naturally: kinship, shared fate, mutual aid. Social ties are not a contract but a family-and-kin fabric. **The aim of existence is harmony.**

- Nature as home, not resource.
- Community as continuation of the natural order.
- Slavery is ontologically inadmissible (violence against the order of the world).

## Western ontology: Human → Society → Nature

The human is born as an **isolated individual**. Society is an artificial construct, a “social contract” to protect private interests. Nature is outside the contract—an external resource to be conquered and put to use. The individual competes for place in the hierarchy; winning grants the right to “release animal nature”—consumption, domination. **The aim of existence is success (self-realization).**

- Society as contract, not kinship.
- Nature as “Other” and resource.
- Slavery as a possible outcome of social struggle; “animal nature” as the privilege of the winner.
