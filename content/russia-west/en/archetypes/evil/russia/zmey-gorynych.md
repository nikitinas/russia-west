# Zmey Gorynych (The external, merciless destroyer)

## Origin

Russian byliny and fairy tales. Chthonic evil, the element of fire and water; the boundary between worlds (Smorodina River, Kalinov Bridge—world of the living and the dead).

## Appearance

A huge multi-headed dragon breathing fire. Dwells by the Smorodina River, at the edge of the world. His appearance is always a catastrophe.

## Which ideal is distorted

Direct opposite of the Bogatyr-defender. If the Bogatyr stands at the boundary and bars evil, the Zmey is evil itself breaking through the boundary. A natural disaster.

## Key traits

- Chthonic nature: hostile nature, elemental force; one cannot negotiate—only defeat.
- Link to the boundary of worlds: demands tribute, abducts people; guardian or usurper of the boundary.
- Multi-headedness: regeneration (cut off one head—two grow); to defeat him requires a single blow to all heads.
- Abductor and destroyer: terror, demand for tribute under threat of fire.
- Fiery nature: his weapon is all-consuming rage.

## Logic of behavior

“I will burn, trample, take captive.” Absolute cruelty, demand for tribute (maidens, wealth). He does not wish to rule the human world—to destroy it or hold it in eternal fear.

## Core sin

Rage and cruelty without limit.

## Projection onto the West

The West as a military machine (NATO): open interventions, bombings (Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Syria), demand for “tribute” (obedience), destruction of those who refuse. Direct attack, terror.
