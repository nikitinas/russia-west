# Paths to Resolving the Conflict

Resolution requires moving to a level different from ordinary political bargaining: breaking the closed loop of mutual fears.

## Path 1: Refusing archetypal projection

Seeing in the other side not a monster from one’s own folklore but **another human with a different ontology**. For the West—to stop seeing in Russia only Leviathan and Golem; for Russia—to stop seeing in the West only Satan and Koschei. Abandoning the language of moral superiority; shifting from “Who is to blame?” to “What can we do to coexist?” Requires leaders capable of thinking of a multipolar world as a symphony of civilizations.

## Path 2: A common existential enemy

A threat equally frightening to both ontologies and not fitting old archetypes: climate catastrophe, technological singularity, cosmic threat. Temporary rapprochement; once the threat is gone, fears may return.

## Path 3: Transformation of one of the worlds

One side loses and adopts the winner’s ontology. In the nuclear age this is unacceptable—the death of one civilization as a whole.

## Path 4: A “roof” or meta-game

Sides agree on **rules of the game** that do not touch ontology: they will believe differently but resolve disputes by procedure. Westphalian sovereignty at a new turn: respect for “ontological sovereignty,” spheres of responsibility. A fragile balance; any crisis can destroy the “roof.”

## Path 5: One-sided “disarmament” of the archetype

An action that cannot be interpreted within the enemy’s archetype. Russia—a strong step toward liberalization as a sovereign choice; the West—recognition of the right to difference and renunciation of “export of democracy.” Risk: the other side may take the gesture as weakness or cunning.

## Path 6: Institutionalizing multipolarity (Westphalia 2)

Recognition of “cultural sovereignty”: Russia has a right to its model, the West to its. Clear red lines and spheres of influence; functional cooperation where it benefits both. The world as an “apartment building”: one’s own apartment, a shared corridor (international law), strict safety rules.

## Path 7: Generational change and cultural diffusion

New generations and “living bridges” (diasporas, exchanges) soften the monolith of the enemy image. A slow but stable path.

## Conclusion

The most realistic approach is a **combination**: meta-game (Path 4) + generational work to deconstruct archetypes (Path 1). Resolution is not the victory of one ontology over the other but checks and balances and a level of cultural dialogue that keeps deep fears from destroying everything.
