# Leviathan (The state as Moloch)

## Origin

Bible—a sea monster, chaos; T. Hobbes—metaphor for the all-powerful state that swallows the will of individuals for the sake of order.

## Appearance

A huge faceless mechanism. Neither human nor beast—a machine: bureaucratic, punitive, all-penetrating. No face, only functions.

## Which ideal is distorted

Distortion of the idea of a free society. People gave away all their freedom in exchange for security and are now absorbed by it. The gravedigger of the Knight and the Renaissance man.

## Key traits

- Total power leaving no room for individual freedom.
- Strength in vastness and relentlessness.
- Demands absolute loyalty, standardization, sacrifice.
- Main instrument—fear and surveillance.

## Logic of behavior

“Everything for the state, everything in the name of the state.” Tolerates nothing unique. Unification, destruction of freedom.

## Core sin

Suppression of the person, total unification, destruction of freedom.

## Projection onto Russia

Russia as “prison of nations”: vertical of power crushing the person; Putin as embodiment of Leviathan; KGB/FSB as tentacles. Fear of total control. Russia’s defense of traditional values and limiting external influence the West reads as state invasion of private life—confirmation of Leviathan.
