# Knight of the Round Table (Lancelot, Galahad)

## Origin

European medieval epic. The noble warrior serving a high idea.

## What it represents

Quest for the Holy Grail, defense of justice. Code of honor, fidelity to word and ideal even against worldly gain. Its distortions—Leviathan (destruction of the knight’s freedom), Dragon (guarding treasure instead of serving the ideal), Shere Khan (denial of law, might makes right). For Russia, her “Bogatyr” in Western reading is the “False Bogatyr,” servant of Leviathan.
