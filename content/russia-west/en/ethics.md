# Different Ethics: Good and Evil

From the two ontologies grow two opposite ethical systems.

## Russian worldview

- **Good:** Harmony, justice (truth), sobornost. Life in accord with conscience, community, and land. Priority of the spiritual over the material. Sacrifice for the whole. Truth above law. Mercy.
- **Evil:** Violation of harmony: pride, selfishness, greed, betrayal of the community, violence against the weak, spiritual emptiness.

## Western worldview

- **Good:** Freedom, responsibility, progress. Freedom of the person from external coercion. Self-realization. Rule of law protecting rights. Innovation, development.
- **Evil:** Restriction of freedom: tyranny, totalitarianism, stagnation, poverty as lack of opportunity, unjust law.
