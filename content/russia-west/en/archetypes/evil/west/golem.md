# Golem (Technology out of control)

## Origin

Jewish mysticism: a clay giant animated by magi, run amok. In modern reading—AI, nuclear power, runaway industry.

## Appearance

A huge clay figure animated by magic. Silent, never tiring, following the order literally—and thus deadly. Soulless.

## Which ideal is distorted

Distortion of the idea of Prometheus. Prometheus brought fire (knowledge) to liberate. The Golem is fire out of control burning its creator. Fear of the creative genius that spawned an unbridled force.

## Key traits

- Dull, uncontrollable mechanical force.
- Devoid of soul and reason but possessed of colossal power.
- Follows the order literally—catastrophe.
- Fear of technology and a soulless machine with no nuance.

## Logic of behavior

Literalism. Ordered to “guard”—it will wall everyone in. Cannot be reasoned with or tricked. Follows the program until it has destroyed everything.

## Core sin

Soullessness, absence of moral compass, mechanism pushed to the absolute.

## Projection onto Russia

Russia as the “Russian bear”: huge, unpredictable force. Cannot be controlled or predicted. Nuclear “Golem.” Russia’s military buildup and military action the West reads as an uncontrollable military machine in motion—confirmation of the Golem.
