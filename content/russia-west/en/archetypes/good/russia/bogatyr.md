# Bogatyr (Ilya Muromets)

## Origin

Russian byliny. The archetype of the defender standing at the boundary.

## What it represents

Strength not in attack but in defense. Calm, confident power that activates only when harmony is threatened by external evil. Serves not the sovereign but the land and the people. Direct opposite of Zmey Gorynych (evil breaking through the boundary); contrast to Koschei (power that does not protect but oppresses).

## Link to the ideal

The ideal of defending borders and justice. To the West, the Russian “Bogatyr” often looks like a servant of “Leviathan.”
