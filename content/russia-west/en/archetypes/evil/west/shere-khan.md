# Shere Khan (The outlaw predator)

## Origin

R. Kipling, “The Jungle Book.” A lame tiger who rules the jungle through fear, without true support of the pack. Power based on brute force and violation of the “law of the jungle.”

## Appearance

A lame tiger—huge, strong, but physically damaged. Rules not by support but by fear. A loner who despises the “pack.”

## Which ideal is distorted

Distortion of just Law and the Knight’s code. The “law of the jungle” taken to the extreme: no rules except the right of the strong. Pure egoism of power.

## Key traits

- Dangerous but “illegitimate” predator.
- Strong but a loner; despises the will of the pack and mutual respect.
- Tries to rule through terror.
- Clever, cunning, cruel; power only through fear. No allies—only vassals waiting for his mistake.

## Logic of behavior

“I’m in charge here because I’m the strongest, and I don’t care about your ‘law of the jungle.’” Arbitrariness, denial of any law except his own will.

## Core sin

Arbitrariness, denial of law, power as personal predatory privilege.

## Projection onto Russia

Russia as violator of international rules: bypassing international law, the UN, invasions (Georgia, Ukraine). Strong but illegitimate; does not play by the rules of the “civilized world,” imposes its will by force. Russia’s display of sovereignty and rejection of Western standards the West reads as Shere Khan—the outlaw predator.
