# Satan (The spiritual corruptor)

## Origin

Judeo-Christian tradition; the image evolved over time. For Russian consciousness—the archetype of metaphysical revolt against the Source, the tempter who tears the person away from the “soborny” body.

## Appearance

Not necessarily a horned monster. Often “angel of light,” a beautiful and clever tempter. His strength lies in eloquence, knowledge, and the ability to play on human desires. He does not attack; he offers.

## Which ideal is distorted

Direct distortion of the idea of Holy Rus’. Satan offers the person knowledge and power over the world, tearing him from “soil” and “kin.” He says: “You shall be as gods”—destroying humble harmony with the Creator and nature.

## Key traits

- Tempter and deceiver: acts through promises of blessings, knowledge, power that lead to fall.
- Adversary and accuser: opposes the divine order, seeks out weaknesses.
- Pride: his aim is to push the person toward the same pride.
- Cunning and intellect: strength in manipulation, not brute force.
- Abstract evil: destruction of souls, not only bodies.

## Logic of behavior

“Is that not enough? Do you not want more? See how meager your life is, and how rich the world could be if you take what is yours.” Inflaming pride and discontent with what is given.

## Core sin

Pride. The wish to rise above one’s place in the world hierarchy.

## Projection onto the West

From the Russian point of view, the West acts as Satan: tempts with mass culture, consumer values, and liberal ideas; offers “freedom” that turns into a rupture of bonds with family, community, tradition, homeland. “Soft power” as seduction and substitution of concepts.
