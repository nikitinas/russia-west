# Mirror Fears and the Closed Loop

Each side sees in the other not merely an opponent but the **embodiment of its own archetypal nightmare**. Actions taken by one side to defend against its fear are read by the other as confirmation of its fear. One side’s “shield” is perceived as the other’s “sword.”

## Mechanism: shield as sword

- Each side has historical trauma and an image of absolute evil.
- Russia builds a strong state as a shield against chaos and invasion; the West builds human rights and democracy as a shield against tyranny.
- The West sees Russia’s “vertical” as Leviathan; Russia sees the expansion of Western values as Satan.

## Symmetric fear pairs

| Russian fear (what it sees in the West) | Russia’s action (defense) | How it looks to the West | Western fear (what it sees in Russia) |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Satan | Defense of traditional values, limiting external influence | State invading private life → Leviathan | Leviathan |
| Koschei | Economic sovereignty, import substitution | “Choking on gold,” not playing by market rules → Dragon | Dragon |
| Zmey Gorynych | Military buildup, red lines, SMO as defense against NATO | Uncontrollable military machine → Golem | Golem |
| Chernomor | Sovereignty, rejection of Western standards | Predator outside the law, blackmail → Shere Khan | Shere Khan |

## The closed loop

Example: Russia fears NATO expansion (the Zmey) → launches a military operation → the West sees the Golem → NATO reinforces presence → Russia takes this as confirmation: “The Zmey is closer.” The loop closes. Exit is possible only by recognizing this structure and taking steps to deconstruct one’s own fears.
