# Roots of the Conflict: Russia and the West

## Subtitle

A first-principles analysis.

## Main thesis

The conflict between Russia and the West is not primarily about economic or political interests but about **clashing ontologies**. Different understandings of the links between human, nature, and society lead to different ideas of good and evil; these differences are fixed in archetypal images. Each side sees the other as the embodiment of its own deepest archetypal evil—a mirror of fears that reinforces the conflict.
