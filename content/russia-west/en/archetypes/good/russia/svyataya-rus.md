# Holy Rus' / The Plowman

## Origin

Cultural archetype of Russia: the search for the “inner kingdom”—justice, truth, not external comfort and might. In contrast to the Western “Faustian man.”

## What it represents

A person living in harmony with the land and God. Strength lies in bond with the native soil, in labor and faith. Does not strive for power over the world—cultivates it. Values: collective mutual aid, mercy, priority of the spiritual over the material, respect for the sovereignty of others.

## Link to the ideal

The ideal of harmony; what Satan distorts (pride, rupture from “soil”) and Chernomor (appearance without substance).
