# Sobor (as idea)

## Origin

N.A. Berdyaev: “Sobornost is free community, knowing no external authority over itself, yet not individualistic isolation.” Byzantine “symphony of powers”—harmonious co-service of different principles.

## What it represents

Unity in freedom. People are gathered not by coercion but by common faith, fate, and cause. Voluntary, organic unity; the person does not dissolve but attains fullness of being. Rejection both of Western rigid individualism and of mechanical collectivism.

## Link to the ideal

The ideal of unity without suppression. Distorted by Koschei (hierarchy of fear) and Chernomor (appearance of unity without substance).
