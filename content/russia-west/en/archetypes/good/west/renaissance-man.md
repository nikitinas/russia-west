# Renaissance Man (Universal genius)

## Origin

The ideal of the free person realizing his or her potential in all spheres. Artist, scientist, inventor, politician in one.

## What it represents

Symbol of the boundless possibilities of the human, forging his or her own fate. Freedom, self-realization, innovation. Leviathan is the gravedigger of this ideal (total unification, suppression of the unique).
